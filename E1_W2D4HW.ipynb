    "<h3>Exercise 1</h3><p>Develop a user-friendly program that acts as an address book. The program should have the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upon starting the program, create an empty dictionary to store names and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Allow the user to add people to the address book. For each entry, prompt the user to input a name and its corresponding address. Store these as key-value pairs in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide a clear and straightforward menu for the user, including options to add a new entry or quit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a loop that allows users to continue adding entries until they explicitly choose to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When the user decides to quit, break out of the loop and display the collected information. Print out the names and addresses of everyone in the address book in a well-formatted manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Consider adding error handling to handle unexpected inputs gracefully. For instance, if the user provides invalid input when prompted for a name or address, handle the error and ask for the information again.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Provide a user-friendly and informative message when the program terminates, summarizing the data entered and thanking the user for using the address book.</p>"
